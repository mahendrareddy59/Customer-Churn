 Customer churn or attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a bank or financial institution by closing their accounts or discontinuing the use
 of its services. This can occur for various reasons, including dissatisfaction with the bank's services, finding better alternatives, or changes in financial circumstances. Banks often
 monitor and analyze churn rates to understand why customers are leaving and to implement strategies to reduce churn. Strategies to mitigate churn may include improving customer service,
 offering better products or incentives, and enhancing the overall banking experience.
